APLedit
=======

A line-editor with a pop-up menu for easely inserting special APL characters
It will be able to interact with various APL interpreters with a special focus
on GNU APL.

Since it uses the readline library, the key bindings can be set in the ~/.inputrc
configuration file of each user. Example:

    $if APLedit
    "\e[2~": apledit-mode             # key "insert"
    "\e[5~": apledit-category-up      # key "page up"
    "\e[6~": apledit-category-down    # key "page down"
    #"\e[5~": apledit-item-up         # key "page up"
    "\e[3~": apledit-item-down        # key "suppr"
    "\e/": apledit-insert-char        # key "menu" (below, next to right-ctrl)
    $endif

The user can customize both prompt (normal prompt and pop-up menu). Using ANSI
escape sequences for color/bold/etc. can also be done.

Previous version would customize the prompt strings by using command line option.
Unfortunately, using variables in ~/.inputrc doesn't seem to be doable. The
solution found now is to use environment variables:

    export APLEDIT_PROMPT2=$'\033[1;33m[%s %s]\033[0m '

or

    export APLEDIT_PROMPT2=$'\033[37;44;1m%s \033[33;45m%s\033[0m '

A few other flags will be described later.
